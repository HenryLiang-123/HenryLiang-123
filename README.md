# Henry Liang

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub. I'm Henry, a machine learning engineer with a passion in knowledge graphs, GenAI, and cloud engineering solutions. I hold a Master's degree in Machine Learning and Data Science from Northwestern University. I currently work as a Data Scientist, working a lot with LLMs.

## Projects

### [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/HenryLiang-123/webllm)
A personal website that has a chatbot. You'll be chatting with Qwen2.5 who knows a fact or 2 about me. The project was built using webLLM and webGPU.

### [CDL Industry Practicum Project: IoT Use Cases](https://github.com/samswain2/CDL-UseCases)
A collaborative project with the Center for Deep Learning at Northwestern University that involved the design, implementation, and maintancence of an IoT streaming data prediction pipeline for three different usecases on AWS.

### [Machine Learning Pipeline](https://github.com/HenryLiang-123/ml-pipeline)
A modular and configurable machine learning pipeline designed to classify cloud types from images. The pipeline can be run locally or inside a docker container, and can save artifacts from the process to anywhere you want.
